# Lab 06 - Person

## Lab Goal
In this lab you will be extending a superclass.  You will also be practicing good object-oriented design in constructing a class. **This is a major grade.**

## Instructions
 * Modify `Student.java` and complete all of the methods using the superclass of `Person` as appropriate.
 * Modify `Teacher.java` and complete all of the methods using the superclass of `Person` as appropriate.
 * Modify `PersonRunner.java` to create and test at least one student and one teacher.
 * Make sure you add a javadoc comment on each method.  You'll need to include a `@param` tag for each method that accepts a parameter.  Include a `@return` tag on any method that returns a value.

## Helpful Resources
 * [Classes (ThinkJava)](http://greenteapress.com/thinkjava6/html/thinkjava6012.html)
 * [Inheritance in Java (Geeks for Geeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-in-java/)

## Notes
* Checkstyle config link is http://www.daveavis.com/cs/checkstyle_SHS.xml
* After cloning your repo from GitHub you can open your code in BlueJ by double clicking on the **package** file.
* Edit the first line of the Readme.md file and put your username in both locations that say "username".  This is necessary if you want the badge at the top of the instructions to show red or green based on your most recent commit.

## Grading
* 40 - `Student` works referencing the superclass as appropriate.
* 40 - `Teacher` works referencing the superclass as appropriate.
* 10 - `PersonRunner` has at least one student and one teacher created and tested.
* 10 - style

Note that these are potential maximums; the computer can only check so much.  If your code passes Checkstyle, but I see non-descriptive variable names, then your style grade will go down.  If your code passes all tests, but I see code that was copied off of the internet or from another student your grade will go *way* down.
